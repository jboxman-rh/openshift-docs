= About network policy

In a cluster using a Kubernetes Container Network Interface (CNI) plug-in that supports Kubernetes network policy, network isolation is controlled entirely by `NetworkPolicy` objects.
In {product-title} {product-version}, OpenShift SDN supports using network policy in its default network isolation mode.

[WARNING]
====
Network policy does not apply to the host network namespace. Pods with host networking enabled are unaffected by network policy rules.
