== Requirements for installing {product-title} on Azure Stack Hub

Before installing {product-title} on Microsoft Azure Stack Hub, you must:

* Configure an Azure account. See xref:../../installing/installing_azure_stack_hub/installing-azure-stack-hub-account.adoc#installing-azure-stack-hub-account[Configuring an Azure Stack Hub account] for details about account configuration, account limits, DNS zone configuration, required roles, and creating service principals.
* Manually manage your cloud credentials when installing a cluster to Azure Stack Hub. Do this by configuring the Cloud Credential Operator (CCO) for manual mode before you install the cluster. For more information, see xref:../../installing/installing_azure_stack_hub/manually-creating-iam-azure-stack-hub.adoc#manually-creating-iam-azure-stack-hub[Manually creating IAM for Azure].

== Choosing a method to install {product-title} on Azure Stack Hub

You can install {product-title} on installer-provisioned or user-provisioned infrastructure. The default installation type uses installer-provisioned infrastructure, where the installation program provisions the underlying infrastructure for the cluster. You can also install {product-title} on infrastructure that you provision. If you do not use infrastructure that the installation program provisions, you must manage and maintain the cluster resources yourself.

See xref:../../architecture/architecture-installation.adoc#installation-process_architecture-installation[Installation process] for more information about installer-provisioned and user-provisioned installation processes.

[id="choosing-a-method-to-install-ocp-on-ash-user-provisioned"]
=== Installing a cluster on user-provisioned infrastructure
